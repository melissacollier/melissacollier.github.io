I'm not just a scientist, I'm also very much a person with a love for fashion, trying new foods, seeing new places, being outside, and reading garbage romance/fantasy novels. So here are 8 fun facts about me (not science related!).


<b>1. I'm a native Floridian,</b> and I love and DEEPLY miss the natural beauty of my home state. It's also why I prefer being hot over cold, and why I hate the snow.

<b>2. I have a twin sister,</b> and we are complete opposites. No she's not a scientist. Yes she's an extrovert. Yes she is an amazing singer. No she's not older-I am by two minutes. Yes I'm obsessed with her dog.

3. My favorite US destination is a complete tie between Georgia's golden coast (St. Simon's Island, Jekyll Island, Savannah, etc.) and Glacier National Park in Montana. But I still have so many more states to visit!

I'm slowly increasing my passport stamps (8 countries so far), but as of now my favorite international destination has been Co. Donegal in Ireland. Such an underrated and STUNNING part of the country, with the absolute best locals. Galway did have the best food though.

I currently own ~25 plants after a freeze came through when I was out of town and killed about 10. I will avidly try to convince anyone who will listen that they can be a great plant parent too, and to not let the one plant you killed in college scare you away.

I've had the same 3 best friends since freshman year of high school (18 years, plus my twin sister). None of them are scientists, and they help remind me that there is so much more to life than publishing, grants, and frustrating data.

Sign me up for any and all chefs menus, food tours, and cooking classes. Favorite Foods I've had so far this year (2024): lobster roll, chicken street tacos, and Pastel de Natas.

Matcha over coffee always. Except for espresso martinis.

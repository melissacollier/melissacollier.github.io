Hi! I'm Melissa, a postdoctoral fellow with the [Bansal Lab](https://www.bansallab.com/) at Georgetown University. My research examines the impact of social behavior on disease transmission in wildlife species. I am currently funded by the [Morris Animal Foundation's](https://www.morrisanimalfoundation.org/article/morris-animal-foundation-funds-8-new-wildlife-health-studies) Wildlife Training Fellowship.

My main focus is on respiratory disease spread in marine mammal populations. I currently lead research on disease transmission and health of dolphins in the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay with the [Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project](https://pcdolphinproject.org/).

I also focus on meta-analytic work to examine general disease transmission processes across animal social systems, and I am the data manager for the [Animal Social Network Repository](https://bansallab.github.io/asnr/index.html). 

Check out my [publications](https://melissacollier.github.io/publications/) and [research](https://melissacollier.github.io/currentresearch/), and feel free to reach out with questions or collaborations. Thanks for stopping by!
